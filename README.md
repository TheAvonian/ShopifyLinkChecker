# Shopify Link Checker
This is an application I made just for fun but mainly to take away the stress of spamming F5 during FCFS drops.

## This will not automatically purchase an item for you
This is able to bring you to the checkout page with the item in your cart but that's about it.

## What is variant product name
Quite simply some FCFS shopify websites will try to put up fake products behind the scenes with the name of the product you want, <br>
this makes it annoying when searching for the title sometimes so to combat that I use a variant name instead. If you were to want <br>
a pair of shoes they'll behind the scenes have a title and variants for different options to select for it. The variant option you <br>
want is what I am searching for as shopify doesn't use the title of the item's id to put in your cart but instead the variant id.

### About
I created this after finding out some shopify websites are very poorly put together and leave endpoints exposed for the user. <br>
With that said this application doesn't support all shopify websites and if you are having issues that is why.
